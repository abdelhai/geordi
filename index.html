            <h1 class="heading-2">Hello there, friend!</h1></div>
        <p>My name is <strong class="bold-text">Geordi</strong>. I'm your <span class="text-span">Chief Engineer</span> for special projects.
            <br>
            <br>My mission is to take care of developing software utilities and services for your company, to help you focus on your main mission.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>What can my team and I do for you?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create utilities and services to automate repetitive tasks.</li>
                <li>Connect multiple services together through custom logic.</li>
                <li>Create internal apps, dashboards, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Who is this good for?</h3>
            <p>Usually, Marketing, Sales or similar teams who likely don't have development resources easily available to them.</p>
            <p>But we are also very happy to support software engineers who lack the time and resources for non-mission critical programs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How much does it cost and how will you bill me?</h3></div>
        <p>We will bill you by project. The cost will most likely be lower than your engineers.
            <br>Low cost doesn't mean low quality. We work with great developers from around the world and re-use code when appropriate to reduce ETA and cost.</p>
        <div>
            <h3>Can you create us a Holodeck?</h3></div>
        <p>With the current advancement in VR, AR, and AI, I don't see why not. Additionally, with our patented, Blockchain-based DiffractoBeamâ„¢ technology, this could be achieved in a couple of hours.</p>
